# bindings-hamlib

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodeBlock/bindings-hamlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodeBlock/bindings-hamlib)

Haskell FFI bindings to hamlib.

NOTE: This is a very raw binding. It is probably best to create a nice, Haskell
library over this raw binding. I haven't started on this yet.

LGPL: Same as hamlib itself.
