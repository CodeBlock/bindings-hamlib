# hamlib-haskell

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodeBlock/hamlib-haskell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodeBlock/hamlib-haskell)

Haskell FFI bindings to hamlib.

NOTE: This is a very raw binding. It is probably best to create a nice, Haskell
library over this raw binding. I haven't started on this yet.

LGPL: Same as hamlib itself.
